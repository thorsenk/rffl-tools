# Session AAR - AAR Definition & Template Creation

**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Focus:** Defining AAR (After-Action Review) concept and creating session AAR template

## What Was Planned
- Define what an AAR is in the context of this project
- Create a reference document for session AARs

## What Actually Happened
- Read existing AAR documentation (`docs/aars/README.md`) and example (`AAR_2025-12-20_FORENSIC_AGENT_BUILD.md`)
- Created comprehensive AAR definition document at `.cursor/commands/session-aar.md`
- Document includes:
  - Clear definition of AAR concept
  - Purpose and value proposition
  - When to create session AARs (criteria)
  - Quick session template for individual coding sessions
  - Reference to full template for major projects
  - Examples and references

## What Went Well
- ✅ Existing AAR structure provided excellent reference material
- ✅ Clear distinction between session AARs (quick) vs. project AARs (comprehensive)
- ✅ Template is actionable and easy to use
- ✅ Documented both quick and full templates for different use cases

## Challenges / What Didn't Go Well
- None - straightforward documentation task

## Key Learnings
- **AAR Structure:** The project already has a well-established AAR process for major builds
- **Template Hierarchy:** Quick session template complements the full project template
- **Cursor Commands:** `.cursor/commands/` directory is the right place for reusable command templates

## Next Steps
- [ ] Use this template for future significant coding sessions
- [ ] Consider creating a sessions subdirectory if session AARs accumulate
- [ ] Review and refine template based on actual usage

## Code/File Changes
- `.cursor/commands/session-aar.md` - Created new AAR definition and template document
- `docs/aars/Session_AAR_2025-12-21_AAR_DEFINITION.md` - This session AAR document

**Session Type:** Documentation
**Complexity:** Low
**Value:** High - Establishes reusable process for knowledge capture
