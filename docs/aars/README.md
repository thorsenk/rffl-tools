# After-Action Reviews (AARs)

This directory contains After-Action Review (AAR) documents for major project builds, implementations, and significant development efforts.

## Purpose

AARs document:
- What was planned vs. what actually happened
- What went well and what didn't
- Lessons learned and recommendations
- Metrics and outcomes
- Next steps

## Naming Convention

AAR files follow the pattern:
```
AAR_YYYY-MM-DD_PROJECT_NAME.md
```

Examples:
- `AAR_2025-12-20_FORENSIC_AGENT_BUILD.md`
- `AAR_2025-01-15_DATA_MIGRATION.md`

## Current AARs

- **2025-12-20** - [Forensic Agent System Build](AAR_2025-12-20_FORENSIC_AGENT_BUILD.md)
  - Complete forensic investigation agent system implementation
  - RFFL-INQ-2025-001 case study

## When to Create an AAR

Create an AAR for:
- ✅ Major feature implementations
- ✅ Significant refactoring efforts
- ✅ System architecture changes
- ✅ Complex multi-phase projects
- ✅ Projects with important lessons learned

Don't create an AAR for:
- ❌ Minor bug fixes
- ❌ Simple feature additions
- ❌ Routine maintenance tasks

## AAR Template

When creating a new AAR, use the following structure:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
2. **Mission/Objective** - Goals and success criteria
3. **Timeline** - Phase-by-phase breakdown
4. **What Was Planned** - Original architecture and tasks
5. **What Actually Happened** - Implementation sequence
6. **What Went Well** - Successes and strengths
7. **What Didn't Go Well** - Challenges and resolutions
8. **Lessons Learned** - Technical and process insights
9. **Recommendations** - Immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term
10. **Metrics & Outcomes** - Quantitative results
11. **Next Steps** - Action items
12. **Conclusion** - Overall assessment
