# KORM - King of Rage Mountain

KORM is the RFFL's weekly elimination competition running alongside the regular fantasy football season. Teams compete to avoid being the lowest scorers each week, with the last team standing claiming the title of King of Rage Mountain.

## Rules

### Overview
- All 12 teams enter KORM at the start of the season
- Each week, the lowest-scoring teams receive **strikes**
- A team with **2 strikes** is **eliminated**
- Competition continues until only **1 team remains** (or the KORM window ends)

### Strike Mode

|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| 5 or more    | 2-strike    | Bottom 2 scores  |
| 4 or fewer   | 1-strike    | Bottom 1 score   |

### Tie Handling
- All teams tied at a strike threshold receive strikes
