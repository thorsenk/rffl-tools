inquiry:
  summary: "Is the 12-point 'double dip' on return TDs exploitable?"
  full_text: |
    I noticed that when Rashid Shaheed (WR, SEA) returned a kickoff for a 
    touchdown in Week 16, the Seattle D/ST also received 6 points for the 
    same play. If an owner happens to roster both the individual player AND 
    the team's D/ST, they get 12 points for a single play. Is this working 
    correctly? Does this create an exploitable advantage?
